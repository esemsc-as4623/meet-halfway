the privacy challenge
- ID contains a lot of data (multi-purpose)
- but not all data is relevant in all situations
- we want to show proof without revealing all parts of identity (selective disclosure)

blockchain
- 1st Gen = transact
- 2nd Gen = smart contracts
- 3rd Gen = governance
- 4th Gen = privacy (Midnight)

tokenomics
- NIGHT = governance / utility token (native blockchain token)
    - send, receive, vote
- DUST = network resource
    - produced by the amount of NIGHT held in wallet
    - when you create a transaction, you generate DUST
    - DUST is re-generated as long as NIGHT is held

zero-knowledge circuits
- verify info without revealing info
- convience a verifier by proving that all the other possibilities cannot be true
- mathematical tools that encode a program into a set of constraints
- circuits generate proofs for confidential computations and verifiability

smart contracts
- contracts are off-chain
- zero-knowledge proofs are on-chain
- compact smart contract language (TypeScript syntax)
- compact compiler
