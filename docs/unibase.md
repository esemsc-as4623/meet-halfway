decentralized memory layer for agents
- agent persistent memory
- interoperability challenges
- self-evolution

decentralized components
- DID
- wallet
- memory

decentralized layer
- profile
- prompt
- RAG
- LLMs

agent frameworks
- e.g. AI16z, Virtuals, BitAgent

core modules
- membase (content)
- AIP (agent collaboration)
- unibase DA (storage retrieval)

standards
- ERC-8004
    - every agent has a digital passport
    - reputation data (e.g. logs, feedback, payment proofs)
    - on-chain AgentID links to off-chain URI
    - features
        - agent discovery
        - task executation
        - long term autonomy and self-learning
- x402
    - verifiable, gasless payments
    - secure token approvals
    - handle gas and routing
    - long-term memory = agent can accept payment without gas = users can pay without holding BNB
